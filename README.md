JitterTrap is a network measurement and impairment tool for developers of real-time applications and devices.

It has two broad areas of use:
* detection and measurement of unexpected delays, introduced by the device or application under test. That is, characterising the source behaviour with respect to throughput, packet rates, jitter.
* introducing and controling known network impairment conditions (eg. delay, jitter, packet loss) to verify the correct operation of the device or application under test. That is, characterising the behaviour of the destination, with respect to delay, jitter and loss.

The user interface is implemented as a web application.
